        <section class="project">
            <h3>Italian Dual Citizenship Research - Sicilian Lineage to Citizenship</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A client needed to trace their Italian ancestry back to their great-grandfather who emigrated from Sicily in 1903 to qualify for Italian citizenship by descent (jure sanguinis). The family had lost touch with their Italian roots and possessed only a single faded photograph and an approximate village name.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> We began by locating the ancestor's naturalization records in U.S. archives, which confirmed he naturalized after his child's birth—a critical requirement for citizenship eligibility. Using ship passenger manifests from Ellis Island, we identified his exact town of origin: a small comune in the province of Palermo. We then contacted the Italian municipality directly to obtain certified birth certificates for four generations, navigating the complex Italian bureaucracy and language barriers on behalf of our client.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> We successfully compiled a complete documentation package including all required Italian vital records with proper certifications and apostilles, U.S. birth and marriage certificates, and proof of lineage continuity. The client successfully applied for Italian citizenship through their local consulate. Total research time: 25 hours over 8 weeks.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h3>African American Genealogy - From Slavery to Freedom in South Carolina</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A family sought to trace their African American lineage beyond the 1870 census—a common genealogical brick wall due to the lack of surname records for enslaved individuals. They knew their ancestors had lived in the South Carolina Lowcountry but had no documentation prior to Reconstruction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> We employed specialized African American genealogy research techniques, beginning with Freedmen's Bureau records which revealed labor contracts naming the former slaveholder. Using plantation records and the 1860 slave schedule, we identified the family group on the plantation. Post-emancipation, we traced the family through county courthouse marriage records, land deeds showing property acquisition, and African American church records. We also utilized military records from the Civil War Colored Troops.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> We successfully documented five generations of this family, breaking through the slavery barrier to identify their ancestors back to approximately 1840. The project culminated in a comprehensive family tree, a detailed narrative history honoring their ancestors' resilience and achievements, and copies of over 40 historical documents. The family held a reunion to share these discoveries. Research time: 30 hours over 3 months.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h3>Scots-Irish Immigration Research - Ulster to Appalachia</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A client wanted to understand their Scots-Irish heritage and trace their family's immigration to America in the 1800s. Family tradition held that ancestors came from Northern Ireland, but no documentation existed beyond 1900 in the United States.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> Working backward from U.S. census records, we identified the immigrant generation in Pennsylvania. Ship passenger lists revealed their departure from Belfast in 1848 during the potato famine era. In Northern Ireland, we accessed Presbyterian church records (the predominant faith of Scots-Irish immigrants) to trace the family in County Antrim back to the 1790s. We also researched historical context about the Ulster Scots migration patterns and the economic conditions that prompted emigration.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> We created a comprehensive immigration narrative spanning three countries (Scotland, Ireland, and America) and documenting the family's journey from Scottish Lowlands to Ulster Plantation to Appalachian settlement. The deliverable included a beautifully written 15-page historical narrative with period photographs, maps showing migration routes, timeline of family events, and authenticated copies of all records. Research time: 18 hours over 6 weeks.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h3>Multi-Generational Italian Family Tree - Noble Lineage Research</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A client with family tradition of noble ancestry in Northern Italy wanted to verify these claims and build a comprehensive family tree extending as far back as records allowed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> We conducted extensive research in Italian state archives (Archivi di Stato) and parish church records in Lombardy. Working through centuries of Latin parish registers and Italian civil records, we traced the lineage back to the early 1600s. We verified the family's connection to minor nobility through heraldic records and notarial documents showing property transactions and titles.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> We documented 12 generations of this Italian family line, confirming their ancestral connection to a landed family with a documented coat of arms. The family tree included over 200 individuals with detailed information about occupations, properties, and family relationships. We also provided historical context about the social structure of Renaissance and early modern Italy. The client commissioned a formal family history book based on our research. Research time: 40 hours over 4 months.</p>

        <section class="project">
            <h3>Immigration Records Research - Ellis Island to New York City</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Multiple family members wanted to trace their Italian immigrant ancestors who arrived through Ellis Island in the early 1900s and settled in New York City, but had conflicting information about names and dates.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong> We systematically searched ship passenger manifests allowing for name variations (Italian names were often Americanized or misspelled by immigration officials). Once we identified the correct arrival, we used the ship manifest information to locate the family in New York census records. We then traced them through naturalization records, vital records in New York City, and Italian records from their village of origin to build a complete picture.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> We identified the precise ship, date of arrival, and port of origin for three related families who traveled together from the same Italian province. We documented their settlement pattern in Manhattan, their naturalization process, and their economic activities in New York. The project included authenticated copies of all immigration documents, family group sheets, and a narrative describing the immigrant experience. Research time: 15 hours over 5 weeks.</p>
