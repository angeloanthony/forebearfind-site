            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>My journey into genealogy began in 1997, just after returning from a two-year church mission. With curiosity and a notebook in hand, I set out to explore my own family roots. That search led me to the heart of San Vito Chietino, a medieval town perched on the Adriatic coast, where I was granted access‚Äîafter some persistence‚Äîinto the old parish church.</p>
            <p>Inside a small, timeworn room of stone and silence, I discovered something magical: centuries-old books, some dating back to the late 1500s. Their pages were filled with inked names and family stories that had patiently waited generations to be rediscovered. With a quiet sense of wonder, I spent hours copying every potential clue by hand. The priest would occasionally peek in, puzzled at how someone could lose track of time so completely in that dusty archive. But I was enchanted.</p>
            <p>Outside, the town offered its own kind of serenity. The breeze carried the sound of the sea, and the view of the Adriatic‚Äîcalm and endless‚Äîseemed to echo the continuity of family lines.</p>
            <p>As my research grew, so did my journey. I followed family branches into neighboring towns, walking into other churches and archives that hadn‚Äôt been opened in years. In each place, I felt a deeper connection‚Äîwalking where my ancestors had walked, touching the records they left behind.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I ventured to the grand archives in Rome, and later, into more creative pathways. One day, while trying to contact a church in Montereale Valcellina, I couldn‚Äôt get anyone to answer the phone. So, on a whim, I called a local restaurant. The staff couldn‚Äôt help, but someone nearby overheard and suggested a woman who cleaned the church. I found her number in the white pages. She didn‚Äôt have a smartphone, so I found someone in town on Facebook who offered to visit her and take pictures of the documents. A few days later, those precious records arrived through Messenger. It was far from traditional, but it worked‚Äîand it didn‚Äôt cost a dime.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I began helping friends trace their families too: the Oliveri and D‚ÄôAgata families in Sicily, the Bressan family in Northern Italy, and many others. With each story, my passion grew. What started as a personal mission became something more.</p>
            <p>Today, with this website, I hope to share that same spirit of discovery with others‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre just beginning your search or chasing down the last elusive ancestor. Every family has a story waiting to be found. I‚Äôd be honored to help you find yours.</p>
